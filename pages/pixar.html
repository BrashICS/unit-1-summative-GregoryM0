        Steve Jobs importance to Pixar
      </h1>
      <p>
        Steve Jobs acquired the computer graphics division of Lucasfilm, Ltd. and renamed it Pixar Animation Studios in 1986. He remained CEO and majority shareholder until it was acquired by The Walt Disney Company in 2006. After the acquisition, Jobs became Disney's largest individual shareholder and a member of Disney's Board of Directors. Additionally, he was credited as an Executive Producer in Toy Story and is often acknowledged under "Special Thanks" in the credits of Pixar's films, despite having little involvement in productions. Jobs also contributed over $5 million USD in the making of Toy Story.

        Pixar's importance to Computer Science
      </h1>
      <p>
        Pixar is a very important company in the realm of computer science, and the majority of this importance is placed on their invention of CGI. CGI or Computer Generated Imagery is used to produce images for many purposes, including visual arts, advertising, for video games and films, and much more. CGI created a whole new industry through animation and has allowed us to do unbelievable feats. An example of the things CGI has done is through the Avatar movies, where a man is represented as a 10ft tall, pointy eared, blue-skinned alien as a member of the tribe called Na'Vi. The image below displays  the unbelievable graphics that the creation of CGI has led to. Overall CGI has made advancements in computer science through the graphics it has allowed us to create, from movies like Toy Story where it was first used, to now movies like Avatar: The Way of Water. For a more well put answer, "Computer science has drastically changed the way animators work on movies and video games, creating a massive computer-generated imagery (CGI) industry. Thanks to CGI advances, visual effects grow more convincing and easier to create every year." which can be found at Noodle.com.
