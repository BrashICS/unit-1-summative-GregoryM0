            Ipod
        </h1>
        <p>
            The Ipod may not have had as many contributions to computer science, but its impacts in the world are clear. The Ipods ability to provide free content like music disrupted whole industries, for instances, music like stated above, the news/newspaperss, and movies aswell. The Ipod was not as influention in technical terms, but in the importance of the product, it stands side by side with the Iphone. With Steve Jobs at the center of both products, its still had to say that the ipod had no implications in computer science, for example itunes as a new app which influcnced later apps like spotify or apple music. Even these small things had affect on the world we live in today, so the importance of the Ipod to Computer Science still stands through the technological advancements whcih came with it, and the groundwork it lead out for future apps.

            Mac OS
        </h1>
        <p>
            Again, the Mac OS isnt as groundbreaking as the iphone in its direct impacts on computer science and how its done, but the Mac OS is still crucial to coding and computer science. This is because it has been used by programmers for a long time, the Mac OS supports tools and languages such as Python, Ruby, Perl, as well as many other like Unix Systems and Html and Css. The Mac OS is based on Unix and easily runs nearly all Linux software, which makes it such an important peace when it comes to computer science and more directly the programming and coding done within it.
