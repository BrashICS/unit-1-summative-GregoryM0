        </h1>
        <p>
          The NeXt computer is very fascinating, as it was formed mostly from Steve Jobs and other past Apple employees, Steve Jobs created this company after his forced removal of Appple in 1985. NeXt debuted the NeXt computer in 1988, and released te first NeXtcube and smaller NeXtstation in 1990, these systems were also the first of their kind, especially the first computer, as it was the very first computer to utilize the World Wide Web, or to be more specifically, they mad ethe World Wide Web and created the first computer working under it. The NeXt computer was the first computer to utilize the World Wide Web and the worlds first ever web server, which was devised by Sir Tim Berners-Lee. These Machines were mainly used for educational purpurpose, but served as the foundation for future developments like the Macintosh OS which was created by Steve Jobs and Apple after his later return in 1997.
